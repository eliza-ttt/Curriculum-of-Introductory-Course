<h1 align="center">Curriculum-of-Introductory-Course Programming and Mathematics</h1>
**Here's a short brief to introductory course on programming and mathematics, focusing on Calculus 1, Programming Language 1, and Introduction to Computer Science:** <br>

1. Calculus 1:<br> This is the first course in mathematics for computer science students. It introduces the concept of limits, derivatives, and integrals. These fundamental concepts are used to understand and solve real-world problems related to rates of change and area under curves. The course also lays the foundation for more advanced courses in mathematics and computer science.<br><br>

2. Programming Language 1:<br> This is the first course in programming for computer science students. It introduces the basics of programming using a high-level language like Java. Students learn about data types, variables, control structures, functions, and basic data structures. The course aims to develop problem-solving skills and computational thinking, which are essential for software development and algorithm design.<br><br>

3. Introduction to Computer Science:<br> This course provides an overview of the field of computer science. It covers the history of computing, the role of hardware and software, how data is represented and processed, and the basics of operating systems and computer networks. The course also introduces students to the concept of algorithms and their complexity. It's designed to give students a broad understanding of the discipline and how its various elements fit together.<br><br>

These courses provide a solid foundation for further studies in computer science and are essential for anyone aspiring to become a software engineer, data scientist, or any other role in the tech industry. They equip students with the mathematical, logical, and technical skills needed to excel in this rapidly evolving field.<br><br>
